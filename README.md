## About nystudio107/craft

This is an alternate scaffolding package for Craft 3 CMS projects to Pixel & Tonic's canonical [craftcms/craft](https://github.com/craftcms/craft) package.
 
The project is based on [Craft CMS](https://CraftCMS.com) using a unique `templates/_boilerplate` system for web/AJAX/AMP pages, and implements a number of technologies/techniques:
 
* A base Twig templating setup as described in [An Effective Twig Base Templating Setup](https://nystudio107.com/blog/an-effective-twig-base-templating-setup)
* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used for the build system as per [An Annotated webpack 4 Config for Frontend Web Development](https://nystudio107.com/blog/an-annotated-webpack-4-config-for-frontend-web-development)
* [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) is used for some of the interactive bits on the website as per 
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the site-wide CSS
* JSON-LD structured data as per [Annotated JSON-LD Structured Data Examples](https://nystudio107.com/blog/annotated-json-ld-structured-data-examples)

* CLI-based queue as per [Robust queue job handling in Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/robust-queue-job-handling-in-craft-cms)
* FastCGI Static Cache as per [Static Page Caching with Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/static-caching-with-craft-cms)
* [Craft-Scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts) as described in the [Database & Asset Syncing Between Environments in Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/database-asset-syncing-between-environments-in-craft-cms), [Mitigating Disaster via Website Backups](https://nystudio107.com/blog/mitigating-disaster-via-website-backups) & [Hardening Craft CMS Permissions](https://nystudio107.com/blog/hardening-craft-cms-permissions) articles

...and probably a bunch of other stuff too.

## Using nystudio107/craft

This project package works exactly the way Pixel & Tonic's [craftcms/craft](https://github.com/craftcms/craft) package works; you create a new project by first creating & installing the project:

    composer create-project nystudio107/craft PATH

Make sure that `PATH` is the path to your project, including the name you want for the project, e.g.:

    composer create-project nystudio107/craft craft3

Then `cd` to your new project directory, and run Craft's `setup` console command to create your `.env` environments and optionally install:

    cd PATH
    ./craft setup

Finally, run the `nys-setup` command to configure Craft-Scripts based on your newly created `.env` settings:

    ./nys-setup

That's it, enjoy!

If you ever delete the `vendor` folder or such, just re-run:

    ./nys-setup

...and it will re-create the symlink to your `.env.sh`; don't worry, it won't stomp on any changes you've made.
